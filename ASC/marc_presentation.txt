1. predict product success by estimating product demand 
    - can't use a test market
    - stated opinions are unreliable- instead, have people show instead of state preferences

2. products are defined by attributes, each with a number of levels
    - ex: headphones: brand, price, eartip, etc

3. preference estimates are used to make counterfactual predicitions in a simulated market

4. discrete choice: you can only choose one product
